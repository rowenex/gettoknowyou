# gettoknowyou

Tutorial: run the mainfile.m and read the rules displayed. Following the rules, answer the questions given to you in English, French, or Spanish!
The program will then ask you the next question using the language that you used, and display the country's flag. 
You can use other languages too, but there will be no flag, and the questions will default to English.
Each answer in a language is counted, and the count will be displayed.
